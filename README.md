## Description

This Ruby library is a wrapper for the ProfitBricks REST API. All API operations are performed over SSL and authenticated using your ProfitBricks portal credentials. The API can be accessed within an instance running in ProfitBricks or directly over the Internet from any application that can send an HTTPS request and receive an HTTPS response.

This guide will show you how to programmatically perform common management tasks using the ProfitBricks SDK for Ruby.

## Getting Started

* ProfitBricks account

Before you begin you will need to have [signed-up](https://www.profitbricks.com/signup) for a ProfitBricks account. The credentials you setup during sign-up will be used to authenticate against the API.




## Installation

The official ProfitBricks Ruby library is available from the ProfitBricks GitHub account found [here](https://github.com/profitbricks/profitbricks-sdk-ruby). You can download the latest stable version by cloning the repository and then adding the project to your solution.

Once the SDK is downloaded:

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'profitbricks-sdk-ruby'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install profitbricks-sdk-ruby

### Authenticating

Connecting to ProfitBricks is handled by first setting up your authentication credentials.

To setup your credentials you will have to provide configure and provide your username and password

    ProfitBricks.configure do |config|
      config.url = 'https://api.profitbricks.com/cloudapi/v3/'
      config.username = ENV['PROFITBRICKS_USERNAME']
      config.password = ENV['PROFITBRICKS_PASSWORD']
      config.debug = false
      config.timeout = 300
      config.interval = 5
      config.depth=5
    end


You can choose to read them from the environment variables like in the example above, or just provide the strting value for *username* and *password*.

## Reference

This section provides details on all the available operations and the parameters they accept. Brief code snippets demonstrating usage are also included.

### Data Centers

Virtual data centers (VDCs) are the foundation of the ProfitBricks platform. VDCs act as logical containers for all other objects you will be creating, e.g., servers. You can provision as many VDCs as you want. VDCs have their own private network and are logically segmented from each other to create isolation.


#### List Data Centers

This operation will list all currently provisioned VDCs that your account credentials provide access to.

The optional `depth` parameter can be set from the `ProfitBricks.configure` and it defines the level, one being the least and five being the most, of information returned with the response.

```
datacenters = ProfitBricks::Datacenter.list
```

---

#### Retrieve a Data Center

Use this to retrieve details about a specific VDC.

The following table describes the request arguments:

| Name| Required | Type | Description |
|---|:-:|---|---|
| datacenter_id | **yes** | string | The ID of the VDC. |

```
datacenter = ProfitBricks::Datacenter.get(datacenter_id)
```

---

#### Create a Data Center

Use this operation to create a new VDC. You can create a "simple" VDC by supplying just the required *name* and *location* parameters. This operation also has the capability of provisioning a "complex" VDC by supplying additional parameters for servers, volumes, LANs, and/or load balancers.

The following table describes the request arguments:

| Name| Required | Type | Description |
|---|:-:|---|---|
| name | **yes** | string | The name of the data center. |
| location | **yes** | string | The physical ProfitBricks location where the VDC will be created. |
| description | no | string | A description for the data center, e.g. staging, production. |
| servers | no | collection | Details about creating one or more servers. See [create a server](#create-a-server). |
| volumes | no | collection | Details about creating one or more volumes. See [create a volume](#create-a-volume). |
| lans | no | collection | Details about creating one or more LANs. See [create a lan](#create-a-lan). |
| loadbalancers | no | collection | Details about creating one or more load balancers. See [create a load balancer](#create-a-load- balancer). |

The following table outlines the locations currently supported:

| Value| Country | City |
|---|---|---|
| us/las | United States | Las Vegas |
| de/fra | Germany | Frankfurt |
| de/fkb | Germany | Karlsruhe |

**NOTES**:
- The value for `name` cannot contain the following characters: (@, /, , |, ‘’, ‘).
- You cannot change the virtual data center `location` once it has been provisioned.

```
datacenter = ProfitBricks::Datacenter.create(
      name: 'Ruby SDK Composite Datacenter',
      description: 'SDK  Composite test environment',
      location: 'de/fkb',
      servers: [

| imagePassword | **yes** | string | One-time password is set on the Image for the appropriate root or administrative account. This field may only be set in creation requests. When reading, it always returns *null*. The password has to contain 8-50 characters. Only these characters are allowed: [abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvxABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVX23456789] |
| sshKeys | **yes** | string | SSH keys to allow access to the volume via SSH. |
| availabilityZone | no | string | The storage availability zone assigned to the volume. Valid values: AUTO, ZONE_1, ZONE_2, or ZONE_3. This only applies to HDD volumes. Leave blank or set to AUTO when provisioning SSD volumes. |

The following table outlines the various licence types you can define:

| Licence Type | Comment |
|---|---|
| WINDOWS2016 | Use this for the Microsoft Windows Server 2016 operating system. |
| WINDOWS | Use this for the Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and 2012 operating systems. |
| LINUX |Use this for Linux distributions such as CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, etc. |
| OTHER | Use this for any volumes that do not match one of the other licence types. |
| UNKNOWN | This value may be inherited when you've uploaded an image and haven't set the license type. Use one of the options above instead. |

The following table outlines the storage availability zones currently supported:

| Availability Zone | Comment |
|---|---|

* You will need to provide either the `image` or the `licenceType` parameters. `licenceType` is required, but if `image` is supplied, it is already set and cannot be changed. Similarly either the `imagePassword` or `sshKeys` parameters need to be supplied when creating a volume. We recommend setting a valid value for `imagePassword` even when using `sshKeys` so that it is possible to authenticate using the remote console feature of the DCD.

```
volume = ProfitBricks::Volume.create(
  datacenter_id, name: 'my boot volume for server 1',
  size: 5,
  type: 'HDD',
  licenceType: 'UNKNOWN',
  availabilityZone: 'AUTO')
```

#### Update a Volume

You can update -- in full or partially -- various attributes on the volume; however, some restrictions are in place:

You can increase the size of an existing storage volume. You cannot reduce the size of an existing storage volume. The volume size will be increased without requiring a reboot if the relevant hot plug settings have been set to *true*. The additional capacity is not added automatically added to any partition, therefore you will need to handle that inside the OS afterwards. Once you have increased the volume size you cannot decrease the volume size.

Since an existing volume is being modified, none of the request parameters are specifically required as long as the changes being made satisfy the requirements for creating a volume.

The following table describes the request arguments:

| availabilityZone | no | string | The storage availability zone assigned to the volume. Valid values: AUTO, ZONE_1, ZONE_2, or ZONE_3. This only applies to HDD volumes. Leave blank or set to AUTO when provisioning SSD volumes. |

After retrieving a volume, either by getting it by id, or as a create response object, you can change its properties and call the `update` method:

```
volume = volume.update(
 name: 'Resized storage to 15 GB',
 size: 15

After retrieving a load balancer, either by getting it by id, or as a create response object, you can change it's properties and call the `update` method:

```
loadbalancer = ProfitBricks::Loadbalancer.get(datacenter_id, loadbalancer_id)
loadbalancer = loadbalancer.update(
  ip: '10.1.1.2'
  )
```

| nic_id | **yes** | string | The ID of the NIC. |

After retrieving a load balancer, either by getting it by id, or as a create response object, you can call the `associate_balanced_nic` method directly.

```
loadbalancer = ProfitBricks::Loadbalancer.get(datacenter_id, loadbalancer_id)
nic = ProfitBricks::NIC.get(datacenter_id, server_id, nic_id)
balanced_nic = loadbalancer.associate_balanced_nic(nic.id)
```
